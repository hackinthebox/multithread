Create a program that will spawn 2 threads.

A condition variable will be used as a wait condition. 

One thread will add elements to an array. Once the array reaches 10 elements in length. The Condition will be met. The 2nd thread will then print and remove elements from the array.

To DO : 
Use a timedwait example that will timeout after waiting for 30 seconds for condition to occur.
